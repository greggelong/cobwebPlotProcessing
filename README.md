# cobwebPlotProcessing
a place to hold some code for cobweb plots in processing 
 
shows the behavior of stable attracting fixed point and a repeling fixed point of a quadric

it is also in the same form as the logistic equation just scaled up

rx(1-x)

this one is scaled up and uses a k to move it to a chaotic point

.01x(1-x)+k  k=100

see this desmos graph for a description

around k 125 you can see some period doubling 

around k 140you can see the period double again
